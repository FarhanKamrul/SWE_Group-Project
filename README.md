Mawid is effectively a simple to use Appointment Booking platform for patients to look up doctors and book appointments.

1) To use this application, download the ```Prototype``` folder and read the README.txt file in  ```Prototype/submission_prototype``` for further instructions.
2) The ```Production Version``` contains the production version of the application, with an exhaustive backend with complete authentication and an incomplete frontend interface that we will develop upon. To run that, download that folder, run ```npm install``` in both the client and root directories, and type ```npm run dev``` in the command prompt.
